# Let's play Hide and Go Seek!

Have you ever wanted to play hide and go seek, but had no one to play with? We developed goSeek to eliminate this issue. 

# How to play?

When you first open the app, you will be greeted by a landing page. Here, you may create your own lobby or join an already existing one. From here, you will be placed in a room and wait for other players to join. Once the user who create the lobby, "the seeker", starts the game, you should hide! The keeper will have the opportunity to Marco Polo the hiders every thirty seconds. When pinged, the device's of the hiders will chirp, alerting the keeper of their location.
